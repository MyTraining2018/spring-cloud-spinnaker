== Logs, logs, and more logs

When you are attempting to install Spinnaker, there are logs everywhere. The key is to find the right ones.

* Spring Cloud Spinnaker can log information about the deployment process, but once completed, it doesn't gather any more information
* Each Spinnaker module will print out its own logs.

Assuming you installed Spinnaker with a namespace of "test", you can gather information like this...

----
$ cf logs clouddriver-test
----

In another shell

----
$ cf restart clouddriver-test
----

If you watch the "cf logs" command, you should see your copy of clouddriver start up. If there's a major issue, it should render an error,
especially it it's missing settings.

----

* In this console output, you can see that clouddriver is running with Spring Boot 1.2.8.RELEASE.
* The "Started Main in 24.791 seconds" is the indicator that the app is finally up.
* "Container became healthy" is the indicator that the platform can see the app as being up.

== Environment settings

To apply various settings, Spring Cloud Spinnaker "cf pushes" the module and then applies various environment variables settings in Cloud Foundry.
Pay note: it's a LOT of settings. If you see a deployment either empty of environment variables or only containing SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON, then
something has gone terribly wrong with the deployment.

Each of the services has a URL to reach the other relevant microservices. In this case, you can how it builds up the URL for clouddriver to speak to echo.

In this specific example:

* service.echo.baseUrl = ${services.default.protocol}://${services.echo.host}${namespace}.${deck.domain}
* services.default.protocol = https
* services.echo.host = echo
* namespace = -spring
* deck.domain = cfapps.io

This allows the deployer to flexibly adjust each piece as needed.


== Manually deploying Spinnaker

You may be tempted to simple grab the fat JARs for clouddriver, deck, etc. and push them yourself. Unfortunately, that's not an option (yet).

* Each module needs its own property file. clouddriver has clouddriver.yml, igor has igor.yml, etc. But they aren't included in the JARs pulled from
bintray. Netflix wraps each module in a Debian package and has those files in a different location. Spring Cloud Spinnaker grabs those JARs and
dynamically inserts such files right before pushing to your Cloud Foundry instance.
